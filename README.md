# Breast Cancer Detection
In these project I worked on sklearn datasets and predicted "Malignant" or "Benign" on breast cancer dataset with **94%** Accuracy & loss: 0.3921, 

Exposed various feature on cancer details such as finding out which cancer is more malignant,what size,color and other posible indication of cancer.

Made using - 

•sklearn,

•tensorflow,

•sequential model,

•used adam optimizer,accuracy metrics ,Relu activation function for model creation.
